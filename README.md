# Admindashboard
This is a simple Admin Dashboard web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the structure of the dashboard, including a sidebar navigation menu, a main content area with a welcome section, statistics panel, and a recent activity section. The CSS file (dashboard.css) is used to design the layout with a clean dashboard style, proper alignment, spacing, and responsive structure. The JavaScript file (dashboard.js) adds functionality by dynamically displaying dashboard statistics and updating content where needed. This project demonstrates basic front-end concepts such as layout design, DOM manipulation, and dynamic data display in a simple and practical way.
